### Background
Influenza viruses are responsible for the extremely contagious respiratory disease known as the flu, which affects millions of people worldwide every year. It can cause serious problems, especially in sensitive people, and manifest as fever, coughing, and muscle aches. Reducing the impact of influenza outbreaks on public health requires effective prediction and control of these events.

### Problem Statement:
